"""Tests for finalize-session's tmux pane discovery.

These drive the launcher exactly as an agent does - argv in, `--dry-run` report
out - and assert which transport and which pane it selected.
[LAW:behavior-not-structure] nothing here reaches inside _discover_tmux_pane, so
the walk can be rewritten freely as long as the pane it picks stays right.

The process tree is REAL. `nest` builds a chain of genuine processes above the
launcher, so the walk runs against the real ps, real pids, and real elapsed
times; a synthetic process table would only test the parser against this file's
own fiction, and could not notice `ps -eo` failing on some platform. tmux is the
one fixture, because a pane's dead-but-still-listed state cannot be conjured on
demand, and the forging ps in the pid-reuse case wraps the real one rather than
replacing it.

The detached-transport cases have a claude process of their own, planted in the
chain: `nest` re-execs itself under the name `claude` at the top hop, so
`_find_claude_pid` finds a process this suite owns and can name. It is a real
process in the real ancestry, matched by the real walk - the fixture is the NAME
and nothing else. Before that, those cases passed only because the walk climbed
past the chain into whatever real `claude` was running the suite, so a plain CI
runner with no claude-named ancestor saw them DECLINE instead of DETACH and the
suite failed for a reason having nothing to do with the code under test.

# interpreter REWRITES its own command string during startup, so a reading taken at launch
# (".../bin/python3.14 -c ...") stops matching the reading taken seconds later
# (".../Python.app/Contents/MacOS/Python -c ..."). The retirement code then correctly
# refuses to signal what looks like a different process, and the case fails - about one run
# in three. A fixture whose identity mutates cannot be used to test a mechanism whose whole
# job is proving identity has NOT changed.

# The trailing `sleep 1` loop keeps the shell blocked without a long-lived child: when KILL
