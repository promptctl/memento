"""The context ceiling: a session past the hard token maximum may not start new work until it
has run the message-in-a-bottle close-out.

Two events, because one is not enough. Stop has teeth in a session that stops; an autonomous
session never stops, and that is exactly the session the ceiling exists to catch, so
[LAW:no-ambient-temporal-coupling] it is enforced on PreToolUse too, where a loop cannot avoid
it. Denial withholds tools, never the exit, so it cannot wedge a session - which is why
PreToolUse needs no spent-attempt valve and keeps no state.

This bounds a session that would talk itself into continuing, not one trying to escape: git is
permitted by name, so an executable planted under that name is out of scope. Anything
unexpected raises, and a traceback with exit 1 is Claude Code's non-blocking error, so the
session continues and the breakage is visible.
